## Hi there, I'm Joel 👋🏽

**👨‍💻 About Me**

Inspired by Iron Man, I've been passionate about technology since childhood, spending hours building and fixing computers. Initially studying economics, I quickly realized that tech was where my heart truly belonged. Now a junior at Baruch College, majoring in Computer Science, I'm the Vice President of the Baruch ColorStack Chapter and deeply involved in leveraging my skills in Python, R, C++, and SQL to explore Machine Learning and AI. I’m applying this knowledge as a data engineer on a research project focused on urban projections, and preparing to start my own AI research. I aim to use technology to simplify life and innovate for a better tomorrow.

**🌱 What I'm Up To**

- 📘 **Deepening my expertise in Machine Learning:** Actively engaging with advanced ML algorithms and their applications across different domains.
- 🔍 **Focusing on AI for social impact:** Investigating how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to tackle pressing social issues and improve community wellbeing.
