## Hi there, I'm Joel 👋🏽

**👨‍💻 About Me**

Hey! I'm Joel. My passion for technology was sparked by Iron Man as a kid, leading me to spend countless hours building and fixing computers just for fun. Despite starting college as an economics major, it didn't take long for me to realize that my true calling was in tech, much like the young kid in me who wanted to build groundbreaking technology like Tony Stark. Now fully immersed in Computer Science at Baruch College, I serve as the Vice President of the Baruch ColorStack Chapter, where I help cultivate a community of tech enthusiasts. I'm sharpening my skills in Python, R, C++, and SQL, and I'm deeply involved in Machine Learning and AI research. Outside the classroom, I apply my knowledge as a data engineer on a project focused on urban projections and am preparing to launch my own research in AI. This work is a step towards making daily life simpler and systems smarter, fulfilling my childhood dream and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I'm excited about the future of technology and committed to being a part of its evolution, striving every day to bring about the positive change I once imagined.
